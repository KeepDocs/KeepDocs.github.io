# Strong Return on Investment (ROI)
There are two main phases for generating strong returns while operating Keep Network Nodes:
* **Network Bootstrapping with Subsidies** 
* **Network in full Production**


## Network Bootstrapping with Subsidies
There is a strong [staking reward subsidy](https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-economics) for  participants that help bootstrap the Network:

|**Total KEEP [Supply](https://etherscan.io/token/0x85eee30c52b0b379b046fb0f85f4f3dc3009afec)**|**1,000,000,000 KEEP**|
| --- | --- |
| **StakeDrop Subsidies for Random Beacon**|**20,000,000 KEEP (2%)**|
| **StakeDrop Subsidies for ECDSA**|**180,000,000 KEEP (18%)**|


The Subsidies will be distributed following the schedule shown below.

</p>

At the current KEEP token market price this means distributing about USD 45M in rewards for over 24 month.

## Network in full Production
Fees generated for Minting/Burning while operating the Nodes will lead to an attractive return once the overall volume of transfers achieves full Production levels (up to Market Demand)

### Random Beacon Node ROI in Full Production

Below are the results for a Random Beacon Node Operator in several scenarios. The results are attractive if there is high demand for the service.

It is still to be defined what the actual Fee for the Service will be. In the [Random Beacon Staking Rewards](https://keep-network.gitbook.io/staking-documentation/keep-network-staking/keep-and-tbtc-staking-rewards#random-beacon-rewards) document it indicates that Fees could be between $10 and $50 per transaction, so we use both scenarios.

</p>

### ECDSA Node ROI in Full Production

Here are the results for an ECDSA Node Operator in several scenarios. It is still to be defined what the actual Fee for the Service will be. In the [ECDSA Node Staking Rewards](https://keep-network.gitbook.io/staking-documentation/keep-network-staking/keep-and-tbtc-staking-rewards#t-ecdsa-tbtc-rewards) document it indicates that Fees start at 5bps (Basis Points), that means 0.05% of the Value Transferred.

The results are less attractive due to the following facts:

* The high collateral requirements (150% of the Value Transferred)
* A tBTC minted can be held for up to 6 months, with no accrual of interest during that time.

</p>

?> **Note for Keep Team:** We suggest to add a fee (interest) that accrues linearly with time for the investment, in addition to the fees for minting and burning, to improve return for stakers.
