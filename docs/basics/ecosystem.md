## COLLATERAL

### Cream
https://app.cream.finance/


CREAM has approved recently TBTC as a Lending/Borrowing Collateral Asset in this [Governance Vote](https://snapshot.page/#/cream/proposal/QmPiVqdEXUKguQPiTgefE6S4A4KqoYBfM7q5v9hrZVMm23). Plan is that TBTC is available in the next weeks.

This is the first platform that will allow to use TBTC as a collateral for lending/borrowing and increases the utility of TBTC in a big way.
<p align="center">
  <img width="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73607532/103156480-aa678480-4787-11eb-9eeb-c64271d59d61.png">
</p>

**Some Use Cases for TBTC in CREAM:**
- Deposit TBTC
   - Earn interest on the TBTC deposit
   - Use it as Collateral to borrow DAI and put into some DEGEN farm to get the spread between the TBTC interest earned, the DAI interest paid and the farmed gains.
   - Use it as Collateral to borrow CRETH2, which is the ETH2 (yield bearing) version of ETH, used for staking in validators for ETH2. Earn the difference.
   - For extra risk (NOT A RECOMMENDATION): Deposit TBTC, borrow some Asset that you expect to go down in value, sell it, buy back at lower price (i.e. shorting that Asset)
- Borrow TBTC
   - Deposit DAI and borrow TBTC to redeem a KEEP at risk of Liquidation vs buying TBTC on the market if there is a big price slippage; return TBTC when you can mint back

**Some quick history on CREAM:**


It started in August as a Lending Platform, as a Fork of Compound.
They recently announced a Collaboration Yearn, which may increase the utility of the CREAM platform: (https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4)

CREAM differentiates vs Compound and AAVE by focusing on Long Tail Assets, currently 30+ Assets

## Play With TBTC
### tBTCzksync torch

This is a program held by a twitter KOL [Eric](https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1311452208127447044). Eric minted some tBTC and deposited it at zksync. Then he passed the zksync version tBTC to others and a long chain of custodians was build. 

You can see all participants [here](https://allthekeeps.com/torch).

## Potential Adoptions

- [Yearn propsal of TBTC vault](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/request-for-yearn-community-support-for-tbtc-and-creation-of-tbtc-vault-decentralized-bitcoin/6374)

It's an idea for a future TBTC Vault, using TBTC as collateral, borrowing stablecoins, investing, and rebuying more TBTC with the returns.
